# MappingIntro
What kind of information should be mapped? Which tool is best for the job? This presentation and guided tutorial is an attempt to help you answer these questions - or any others about getting started with mapping in the Digital Humanities. It includes a primer on how to identify what kind of data is necessary or amenable to mapping, an evaluative survey of several available tools for mapping (Carto, Tableau, R), and extended tutorials of [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) and [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/).

This workshop was originally offered during the Fall 2018 semester at Rutgers University-New Brunswick through the [New Brunswick Libraries Graduate Specialists program](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/) and the [Rutgers DH Initiative](http://dh.rutgers.edu/).
